# smartcat (sc)

Puts a brain behind `cat`! CLI interface to bring language models into the Unix ecosystem and allow terminal power users to make the most out of LLMs while maintaining full control.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/workflow.gif" />
</p>

What makes it special:

- Made for power users; tailor the config to reduce overhead on your most frequent tasks
- Minimalist, built according to the Unix philosophy with terminal and editor integration in mind
- Good I/O handling to insert user input in prompts and use the result in CLI-based workflows
- Built-in partial prompt to make the model play nice as a CLI tool
- Full configurability on which API, LLM version, and temperature you use
- Write and save your own prompt templates for faster recurring tasks (simplify, optimize, tests, etc.)
- Conversation support
- Glob expressions to include context files

Currently supports the following APIs:

- Local runs with **[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/README.md)** or any server compliant with its format; see the [Ollama setup](#ollama-setup) section for the free and easiest way to get started!  
_(Answers might be slow depending on your setup; you may want to try the third-party APIs for an optimal workflow.)_
- **[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview)**, **[Azure OpenAi](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)**, **[Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)**, **[Mistral AI](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/)**, **[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview)**
- Translations are possible using the **[DeepL (Free)](https://developers.deepl.com/docs)** API.

## Installation

On the first run (`sc`), it will ask you to generate default configuration files and provide guidance on finalizing the installation (see the [Configuration](#Configuration) section).

The minimum configuration requirement is a `default` prompt that calls a setup API (either remote with an API key or local with Ollama).

Now on how to get it.

### With Cargo

With an up-to-date Rust and Cargo setup (you might consider running `rustup update`):

```
cargo install smartcat
```

Run this command again to update `smartcat`.

### Arch Linux

If you are on Arch Linux, you can install the package from the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/smartcat/):

```
pacman -S smartcat
```

### By downloading the binary

Choose the one compiled for your platform on the [release page](https://github.com/efugier/smartcat/releases).

## Recommended Models

Currently the best results are achieved with APIs from Anthropic, Mistral or Openai. It costs about $2-3 a month for typical use with the best models.

## Usage

```text
Usage: sc [OPTIONS] [INPUT_OR_TEMPLATE_REF] [INPUT_IF_TEMPLATE_REF]

Arguments:
  [INPUT_OR_TEMPLATE_REF]  ref to a prompt template from config or straight input (will use `default` prompt template if input)
  [INPUT_IF_TEMPLATE_REF]  if the first arg matches a config template, the second will be used as input

Options:
  -e, --extend-conversation        whether to extend the previous conversation or start a new one
  -r, --repeat-input               whether to repeat the input before the output, useful to extend instead of replacing
      --api <API>                  overrides which api to hit [possible values: ollama, anthropic, groq, mistral, openai]
  -m, --model <MODEL>              overrides which model (of the api) to use
  -t, --temperature <TEMPERATURE>  higher temperature  means answer further from the average
  -l, --char-limit <CHAR_LIMIT>    max number of chars to include, ask for user approval if more, 0 = no limit
  -c, --context <CONTEXT>...       glob patterns or list of files to use the content as context
                                   make sure it's the last arg.
  -h, --help                       Print help
  -V, --version                    Print version
```

You can use it to accomplish tasks in the CLI but also in your editors (if they are good Unix citizens, i.e., work with shell commands and text streams) to complete, refactor, write tests... anything!

**The key to making this work seamlessly is a good default prompt that tells the model to behave like a CLI tool** and not write any unwanted text like markdown formatting or explanations.

## A few examples to get started üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

```
sc "say hi"  # just ask (uses default prompt template)

sc test                         # use templated prompts
sc test "and parametrize them"  # extend them on the fly

sc "explain how to use this program" -c **/*.md main.py  # use files as context

git diff | sc "summarize the changes"  # pipe data in

cat en.md | sc "translate in french" >> fr.md   # write data out
sc -e "use a more informal tone" -t 2 >> fr.md  # extend the conversation and raise the temprature
```

To use the translation feature (assuming there is a default model configured), use it like this:
```
sc translate "Hei maailma"          # Returns "Hello world"
cat essay.txt | sc translate -m fr  # Translates essay.txt to French
```
For translations, the model is interpreted as the target language, example values are `de`, `fr` or `it`.

### Integrating with editors

The key for good integration in editors is a good default prompt (or set of prompts) combined with the `-p` flag for specifying the task at hand.
The `-r` flag can be used to decide whether to replace or extend the selection.

#### Vim

Start by selecting some text, then press `:`. You can then pipe the selection content to `smartcat`.

```
:'<,'>!sc "replace the versions with wildcards"
```

```
:'<,'>!sc "fix this function"
```

will **overwrite** the current selection with the same text transformed by the language model.

```
:'<,'>!sc -r test
```

will **repeat** the input, effectively appending at the end of the current selection the result of the language model.

Add the following remap to your vimrc for easy access:

```vimrc
nnoremap <leader>sc :'<,'>!sc
```

#### Helix and Kakoune

Same concept, different shortcut, simply press the pipe key to redirect the selection to `smartcat`.

```
pipe:sc test -r
```
With some remapping you may have your most reccurrent action attached to few keystrokes e.g. `<leader>wt`!

#### Example Workflows

**For quick questions:**

```
sc "my quick question"
```

which will likely be **your fastest path to answer**: a shortcut to open your terminal (if you're not in it already), `sc` and you're set. No tab finding, no logins, no redirects etc.

**To help with coding:**

select a struct

```
:'<,'>!sc "implement the traits FromStr and ToString for this struct"
```

select the generated impl block

```
:'<,'>!sc -e "can you make it more concise?"
```

put the cursor at the bottom of the file and give example usage as input

```
:'<,'>!sc -e "now write tests for it knowing it's used like this" -c src/main.rs
```

...

**To have a full conversation with a llm from a markdown file:**

```
vim problem_solving.md

> write your question as comment in the markdown file then select your question
> and send it to smartcat using the aforementioned trick, use `-r` to repeat the input.

If you wan to continue the conversation, write your new question as a comment and repeat
the previous step with `-e -r`.

> This allows you to keep track of your questions and make a nice reusable document.
```

# Configuration

- By default, lives at `$HOME/.config/smartcat` or `%USERPROFILE%\.config\smartcat` on Windows
- The directory can be set using the `SMARTCAT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
- Use `#[<input>]` as the placeholder for input when writing prompts; if none is provided, it will be automatically added at the end of the last user message
- The default model is a local `phi3` run with Ollama, but it's recommended to try the latest models and see which one works best for you
- The prompt named `default` will be used by default
- You can adjust the temperature and set a default for each prompt depending on its use case

Three files are used:

- `.api_configs.toml` stores your credentials; you need at least one provider with API key or a local Ollama setup
- `prompts.toml` stores your prompt templates; you need at least the `default` prompt
- `conversation.toml` stores the latest chat if you need to continue it; it's auto-managed, but you can make backups if desired

`.api_configs.toml`

```toml
[ollama]  # local API, no key required
url = "http://localhost:11434/api/chat"
default_model = "phi3"

```

see [the config setup file](./src/config/mod.rs) for more details.

## Ollama setup

1. [Install Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama#ollama)
2. Pull the model you plan on using `ollama pull phi3`
3. Test the model `ollama run phi3 "say hi"`
4. Make sure the serving is available `curl http://localhost:11434` which should say "Ollama is running", else you might need to run `ollama serve`
5. `smartcat` will now be able to reach your local ollama, enjoy!

‚ö†Ô∏è Answers might be slow depending on your setup, you may want to try the third party APIs for an optimal workflow. Timeout is configurable and set to 30s by default.
